'Tree' : A tree is a widely-used data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. It represents relationships between elements, where each node can have zero or more child nodes and at most one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent.


'Binary Tree' :
A binary tree is a type of tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure allows for efficient algorithms for inserting, deleting, and searching for elements.
In a binary tree BT, each node N can have up to two children: left child L and right child R.
For example, if N is a node, it can have children N->L (left child) and N->R (right child).


'Generic Tree' :
A generic tree, or n-ary tree, is a tree where there''s no limit on the number of children a node can have. This type of tree is more flexible than a binary tree and can be used to represent more complex hierarchical structures.

'Ancestor': In a tree, an ancestor of a node is any node that appears on the path from the root to that node.

'Descendant': A descendant of a node is any node that can be reached by starting at that node and moving down the tree.

'Subtree': A subtree is a portion of a tree data structure that consists of a node and all its descendants.

Siblings: Siblings are nodes in a tree that share the same parent node.

'Neighbours': In a tree, this term is less commonly used but can refer to nodes that are either siblings (share the same parent) or adjacent nodes in the tree''s graph representation.


'Root': The root of a tree is the topmost node, with no parent.

'Leaf': A leaf is a node with no children.

'Levels': The levels of a tree represent the distance from the root, with the root being at level 0.
