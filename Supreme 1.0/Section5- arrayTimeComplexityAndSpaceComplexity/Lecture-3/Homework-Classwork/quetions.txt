Q1 -  Merge two arrays/vectors. If a number occurs in both arrays, write it only once in the output.
Input: arr1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, arr2 = {4,5,8,9}
Output: ans = {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9} // Duplicates are not added twice.


Q2 - Question: Find the first quadruplet of distinct numbers in an array/vector that add up to a given target value.
Note: The quadruplet should consist of numbers with different indexes in the array.
Input: arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}, target = 12
Output: Quadruplet found: {1, 2,3,6}

Q3 - Problem: Left rotate a vector by one position.
Input: arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output = {2, 3, 4, 5 ,1}

Question:
Find the majority element in an array. A majority element appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times, where n is the size of the array. If no majority element exists, return -1.

Input: nums = {3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 6}
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, the element 2 appears 4 times out of 7, which is more than ⌊7/2⌋ = 3.
